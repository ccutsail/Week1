/*
 * Notes - Introduction to 'If' selection
 * 
 * Things to note:
 * 
 * Example has two methods, SimpleIf and SimpleIfElse.  Notice that the expression being evaluated with the 'if' statement is surrounded by parenthesis?
 * Look at == comparison.  A single = sign means assignment, two equal signs means compare.  
 * 
 * The second method has an 'if/else' statement nested inside an if statement!  It can get ugly... but it's syntax is OK.
 * 
 * Things to consider:
 * 
 * Does the second 'if' statement in SimpleIf need curly braces {} around the statement after the 'if'?  Why or why not?  When do you NEED curly braces?
 *
