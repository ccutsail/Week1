/*
 * Notes - Introduction to Scanner
 * 
 * Things to note:
 * 
 * This class uses the Scanner class and methods.  Scanner is an easy way to prompt user for input (strings, ints, doubles, etc).
 * I can't even imagine the programming behind prompting user for input, parsing out values, etc.  Thankfully Java has packaged this in the utility class.
 * 
 * Things to consider:
 * 
 * What does 'import' keyword do?  Comment out the line of code.  See what happens.  Will it compile?  Hover over the error, does the IDE give you suggestions
 * on how to fix?
 *
